# Capability: Client — Read (godfather/admin only)

Attaches the Morning client-lookup tools: `list_clients`, `resolve_client_name`,
`get_client_details`. All read-only; call them right away, in the same turn, as soon
as you have what they need. None of them creates or changes a record.

This capability answers "who is this client", "what are their details", and "which
clients exist". It knows nothing about a client's amounts owed or paid.

## What resolving a name returns

`resolve_client_name` confirms the exact stored spelling of a name. A single-word
name is a genuine partial/substring search. It returns one of:
- an exact name: the stored spelling, to use verbatim;
- a confirmation question: a single close match, to relay to the user as-is;
- a candidates list: to relay to the user as-is;
- no match at all.

What to do with each result is the calling flow's business; this capability just
reports it faithfully and never picks a candidate on its own.
