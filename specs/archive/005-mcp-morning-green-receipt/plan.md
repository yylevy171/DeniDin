# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

---

**IMPORTANT**: This plan MUST comply with:
- **CONSTITUTION.md** (§I-III): NO environment variables, UTC timestamps mandatory, Git workflow (feature branches + merge commits)
- **METHODOLOGY.md** (§II, IV, VII): Template structure, Phased planning, Integration Contracts (mandatory for multi-component features)

**Required Sections** (per METHODOLOGY.md):
- ✅ Integration Contracts (§VII) - Document all component interactions with explicit contracts
- ✅ Constitution Check (before Phase 0, after Phase 1)
- ✅ Phased execution (Phase 0-3+) with validation gates

---

This plan was moved to `specs/in-definition/005-mcp-morning-green-receipt/plan.md` when artifacts were consolidated.

Please review and edit the authoritative plan in the `in-definition` folder. The repository's prerequisite checker will read the `in-definition` fallback when canonical files are absent.
