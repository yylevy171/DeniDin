Purpose: Reference vendor copies for Morning (Green Invoice) Python clients.

This folder holds read-only vendor copies of upstream repositories used as
implementation references for `denidin`'s Morning integration.

Repos intended:
- https://github.com/yanivps/green-invoice
- https://github.com/UniProBI/python-greeninvoice-client

Usage:
- Inspect code for auth flow, endpoint names, and request/response shapes.
- Do NOT treat these as production dependencies; adapt code into `src/` as needed.

License:
- Each upstream project retains its own license. Review each repo's LICENSE before reusing code.
